# Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It enables the client to select the appropriate algorithm at runtime.

## Problem Statement

In the context of the provided example, the `ImageStorage` class needs to handle the compression and filtering of images. The compression and filtering algorithms can vary, and the client code should be able to select the appropriate algorithms at runtime without modifying the `ImageStorage` class.

## Solution: The Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy design pattern provides a solution to this problem by separating the different algorithms (in this case, compression and filtering) into their own classes, and then allowing the `ImageStorage` class to use these algorithms through interfaces.

The key components of the Strategy design pattern in this context are:

1. **ICompressor Interface**: Defines the contract for compression algorithms, with a `Compress` method.
2. **JpegCompressor and PngCompressor**: Concrete implementations of the `ICompressor` interface, for JPEG and PNG compression, respectively.
3. **IFilter Interface**: Defines the contract for filtering algorithms, with an `Apply` method.
4. **HighContrastFilter and BlackAndWhiteFilter**: Concrete implementations of the `IFilter` interface, for high-contrast and black-and-white filtering, respectively.
5. **ImageStorage Class**: Holds instances of `ICompressor` and `IFilter`, and uses them to store images through the `Store` method.

By using the Strategy design pattern, the `ImageStorage` class can support different compression and filtering algorithms without modifying its own code. The client can choose the appropriate compression and filtering strategies at runtime by providing the necessary instances to the `ImageStorage` class.

## Example Implementation

Here's an example implementation of the `ImageStorage` class and the related components:

```csharp
// Compressor interfaces and implementations
public interface ICompressor
{
    void Compress(byte[] data);
}

public class JpegCompressor : ICompressor
{
    public void Compress(byte[] data)
    {
        // Implement JPEG compression algorithm
    }
}

public class PngCompressor : ICompressor
{
    public void Compress(byte[] data)
    {
        // Implement PNG compression algorithm
    }
}

// Filter interfaces and implementations
public interface IFilter
{
    void Apply(byte[] data);
}

public class HighContrastFilter : IFilter
{
    public void Apply(byte[] data)
    {
        // Implement high-contrast filtering algorithm
    }
}

public class BlackAndWhiteFilter : IFilter
{
    public void Apply(byte[] data)
    {
        // Implement black-and-white filtering algorithm
    }
}

// ImageStorage class
public class ImageStorage
{
    private readonly ICompressor _compressor;
    private readonly IFilter _filter;

    public ImageStorage(ICompressor compressor, IFilter filter)
    {
        _compressor = compressor;
        _filter = filter;
    }

    public void Store(byte[] data)
    {
        // Apply the selected compression algorithm
        _compressor.Compress(data);

        // Apply the selected filtering algorithm
        _filter.Apply(data);

        // Store the processed image data
    }
}

// Usage
var jpegCompressor = new JpegCompressor();
var highContrastFilter = new HighContrastFilter();
var imageStorage = new ImageStorage(jpegCompressor, highContrastFilter);

var imageData = new byte[] { /* image data */ };
imageStorage.Store(imageData);
```

In this example, the `ImageStorage` class uses the `ICompressor` and `IFilter` interfaces to handle the compression and filtering of images. The client can create different instances of `ICompressor` and `IFilter` implementations (e.g., `JpegCompressor`, `PngCompressor`, `HighContrastFilter`, `BlackAndWhiteFilter`) and pass them to the `ImageStorage` constructor to choose the desired algorithms.

By using the Strategy design pattern, the `ImageStorage` class remains decoupled from the specific compression and filtering algorithms, making it easier to extend, maintain, and test the application.
