# Proxy Design Pattern

## Introduction
The Proxy design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. The proxy object acts as an intermediary between the client and the real object, allowing you to perform additional operations or control the access to the real object.

## Motivation
Imagine you have a class that represents an ebook, and you want to provide a way for users to access the ebook's content. However, loading the ebook's content can be a resource-intensive operation, and you don't want to load the content until the user actually requests to see it. This is where the Proxy design pattern comes in handy.

## Implementing the Proxy Design Pattern
In the provided code example, we can see the implementation of the Proxy design pattern. The `Ebook` class represents the real object, which contains the ebook's content. The `EbookProxy` class acts as a proxy for the `Ebook` class, controlling the access to the ebook's content.

Here's how the code works:

1. The `Library` class has an `add(Ebook ebook)` method that adds a new ebook to the library.
2. When a client requests to open an ebook, the `openEbook(String fileName)` method in the `Library` class is called.
3. The `openEbook()` method checks if the requested ebook has already been loaded. If not, it creates a new `EbookProxy` object and calls its `show()` method.
4. The `EbookProxy` class's `show()` method first checks if the real `Ebook` object has been created. If not, it creates a new `Ebook` object and calls its `show()` method to load and display the ebook's content.

## Lazy Loading with the Proxy Design Pattern
The Proxy design pattern is often used to implement the Lazy Loading pattern, which is a technique where the initialization of an object is deferred until it's actually needed. In the provided example, the `Ebook` object is only created when the client requests to open the ebook, which helps to optimize resource usage and improve performance.

## Benefits of the Proxy Design Pattern
1. **Access Control**: The proxy can control the access to the real object, adding additional checks or operations before allowing the client to access the real object.
2. **Lazy Initialization**: The proxy can delay the initialization of the real object until it's actually needed, improving performance and reducing resource usage.
3. **Transparent Swapping**: The client can seamlessly interact with the proxy without knowing the difference between the proxy and the real object, making it easier to swap the real object with a different implementation.

## Drawbacks of the Proxy Design Pattern
The main drawback of the Proxy design pattern is the increased complexity of the codebase, as an additional layer of indirection is introduced between the client and the real object. This can make the code harder to understand and maintain, especially in simple cases where the overhead of the proxy may outweigh the benefits.

## Real-World Examples
The Proxy design pattern is used in various real-world scenarios, such as:
- **Entity Framework Core and Hibernate**: These ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks use the Proxy pattern to implement lazy loading of related entities, where the actual data is only loaded when it's accessed.
- **Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation)**: The RMI framework uses the Proxy pattern to provide a local proxy object that represents a remote object, allowing the client to interact with the remote object as if it were local.
- **Caching**: Proxy objects can be used to cache the results of expensive operations, providing faster access to the cached data.

## Example: Virtual Proxy
In the provided code, we've seen an example of the Proxy design pattern. Let's consider another example that follows the Gang of Four's naming conventions:

```csharp
public interface ISubject
{
    void Request();
}

public class RealSubject : ISubject
{
    public void Request()
    {
        // Perform some expensive operation
        Console.WriteLine("RealSubject handling request.");
    }
}

public class Proxy : ISubject
{
    private RealSubject _realSubject;

    public void Request()
    {
        // Optional: Perform additional operations before forwarding the request
        if (_realSubject == null)
        {
            _realSubject = new RealSubject();
        }
        _realSubject.Request();
        // Optional: Perform additional operations after the request
    }
}

// Usage
ISubject proxy = new Proxy();
proxy.Request(); // Output: RealSubject handling request.
```

In this example, the `Proxy` class implements the `ISubject` interface and acts as a surrogate for the `RealSubject` class. The `Proxy` class is responsible for creating the `RealSubject` instance when the `Request()` method is first called, and it can optionally perform additional operations before and after forwarding the request to the `RealSubject`.

This is an example of a Virtual Proxy, where the proxy is used to control the creation and access to the real subject.

## Conclusion
The Proxy design pattern is a powerful tool for controlling access to an object, implementing lazy initialization, and providing additional functionality without modifying the core object. By using the Proxy pattern, you can decouple the client from the real object, making your code more flexible and maintainable. However, it's important to carefully consider the trade-offs, as the increased complexity can be a drawback in simple cases.

Overall, the Proxy pattern is a valuable addition to your design pattern toolbox, especially when working with resource-intensive or remotely accessed objects.
