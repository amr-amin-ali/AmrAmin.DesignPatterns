# Template Method Design Pattern in C#

## Overview
The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, called the template method, which defers some steps to subclasses. It lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

## Motivation
Imagine you have a set of related algorithms that share a common high-level structure, but differ in their implementation details. The Template Method pattern allows you to extract the common structure into a base class, and let the subclasses provide their own implementations for the varying parts.

This approach has several benefits:

1. **Code Reuse**: By encapsulating the common algorithm structure in the base class, you can avoid duplicating code across the subclasses.
2. **Flexibility**: Subclasses can override the specific steps of the algorithm without changing the overall structure.
3. **Extensibility**: New subclasses can be added without modifying the existing code.

## Structure
The Template Method pattern consists of the following components:

1. **AbstractClass**: Defines the template method and the primitive operations that subclasses must implement.
2. **ConcreteClass**: Implements the primitive operations defined in the AbstractClass.

## Example Implementation in C#

Let's consider an example of brewing coffee and tea using the Template Method pattern.

```csharp
// AbstractClass
public abstract class BrewingProcess
{
    public void TemplateMethod()
    {
        BoilWater();
        Brew();
        PourInCup();
        AddCondiments();
    }

    protected abstract void Brew();
    protected abstract void AddCondiments();

    private void BoilWater()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Boiling water");
    }

    private void PourInCup()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Pouring in cup");
    }
}

// ConcreteClass - Coffee
public class BrewCoffee : BrewingProcess
{
    protected override void Brew()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Brewing coffee");
    }

    protected override void AddCondiments()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Adding sugar and milk");
    }
}

// ConcreteClass - Tea
public class BrewTea : BrewingProcess
{
    protected override void Brew()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Brewing tea");
    }

    protected override void AddCondiments()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Adding lemon");
    }
}

// Usage
var coffee = new BrewCoffee();
coffee.TemplateMethod();
// Output:
// Boiling water
// Brewing coffee
// Pouring in cup
// Adding sugar and milk

var tea = new BrewTea();
tea.TemplateMethod();
// Output:
// Boiling water
// Brewing tea
// Pouring in cup
// Adding lemon
```

### Access Modifiers Explanation
In this example, we have used the following access modifiers:

1. **public**: The `TemplateMethod()` method is marked as `public` to allow client code to call it.
2. **protected**: The `Brew()` and `AddCondiments()` methods are marked as `protected` to allow the concrete subclasses to override them, but prevent direct access from the client code.
3. **private**: The `BoilWater()` and `PourInCup()` methods are marked as `private` to encapsulate the implementation details of the algorithm and prevent them from being overridden by the subclasses.

The choice of these access modifiers is based on the following principles:

- **Information Hiding**: By using `private` and `protected` access modifiers, we hide the implementation details of the algorithm from the client code and the subclasses, respectively. This promotes modularity and maintainability.
- **Encapsulation**: The `protected` access modifier allows the subclasses to access and override the primitive operations, while the `private` access modifier ensures that the internal steps of the algorithm are not directly accessible.
- **Flexibility**: The `protected` access modifier gives subclasses the flexibility to override the primitive operations and customize the algorithm's behavior.

## When to Use the Template Method Pattern
The Template Method pattern should be used when:

1. **You have a common algorithm structure with varying steps**: If you have a set of related algorithms that share a common high-level structure but differ in their implementation details, the Template Method pattern can help you extract the common structure and allow subclasses to provide their own implementations for the varying parts.
2. **You want to control the extension points of an algorithm**: By defining the template method and the primitive operations, you can control the extension points of the algorithm and ensure that the overall structure is maintained.
3. **You want to avoid code duplication**: By encapsulating the common algorithm structure in the base class, you can avoid duplicating code across the subclasses, promoting better code reuse and maintainability.

## When Not to Use the Template Method Pattern
The Template Method pattern may not be the best choice in the following scenarios:

1. **Simple algorithms**: If the algorithm is simple and does not have a significant amount of variation, the overhead of creating an abstract base class and concrete subclasses may not be justified.
2. **Highly dynamic algorithms**: If the algorithm needs to be modified frequently or has a high degree of variability, the Template Method pattern may not be the best fit, as it can make the codebase more rigid and harder to change.
3. **Tight coupling**: The Template Method pattern introduces a tight coupling between the abstract base class and the concrete subclasses, which can make the codebase more difficult to maintain and test.

## Conclusion
The Template Method design pattern is a powerful technique for organizing and managing related algorithms. By separating the common structure from the varying implementation details, it promotes code reuse, flexibility, and extensibility. While it can introduce some complexity, the benefits of the pattern often outweigh the drawbacks, making it a valuable tool in the software developer's arsenal.
